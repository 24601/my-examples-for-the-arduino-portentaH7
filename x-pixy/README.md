|This folder is for examples using the portenta with the pixy2 Charmed labs color detection webcam.

Note: The pixy library for the arduino does not work out of the box, you have to delete the last 4 files. this zipped file is a working Adruno library that needs to be unzipped and then put in your local libraries folder. (where all you other libraries are stored.)


I think SCK on the Portenta is CK

PortenaH7 --> Pixy2  
+5V --> VIN  
GND --> GND
D10 --> MISO   
D9  --> SCK   
D8  --> MOSI
