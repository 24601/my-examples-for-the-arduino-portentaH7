This is all about training the portenta to recognise a few objects using a web cam. May take a while to get going as I don't even have a webcam for my Portenta

Help would be appreciated ass I need internet links to images of portenta's, SeeduinoXIAO, and other boards that will be the negative answers.


The webpage in TensroflowJS format is the index.html file but can be accessed using this link

https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/m09-Tensoflow/x-big-demos/single_image/index.html

It needs work. I have to put a sving folder and then list all the images we have found. Then I will have to convert the saved model to a c header file and then try to get it working. Should be fun.
