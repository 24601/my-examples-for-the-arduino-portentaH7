# Machine Learning on Microcontrolers

I have made 100's of Machine Learning models using [TensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) my examples [here](http://rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs) and my personal opinion is that they are not yet ready for microcontrols. 
in this directory I will show whatever I can get working on the Portenta, however, my solution is to use a powerful cell phone to do the Machine Learning and to connect 
that cell phone to the microcontroller using a web socket. I am in the process of converting this concept to arduino boards.


My toy car web socket TensorflowJS solution of Machine Learning using microcontrollers youtube video is at
